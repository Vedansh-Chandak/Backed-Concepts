My Backend Development Concepts
Welcome to my backend development journey! ðŸš€ Along the way, Iâ€™ve explored essential concepts that form the backbone of server-side development. From managing routes to implementing middleware, these concepts have strengthened my understanding of building scalable and efficient web applications.

Concepts Iâ€™ve Learned
Controllers: Efficiently handle application logic by separating concerns and keeping code organized.
Routing: Manage API endpoints and direct requests using Express.js for a seamless client-server connection.
Middleware: Implement functions to process requests, handle authentication, error management, and logging.
These concepts have enabled me to build cleaner, more maintainable applications while following best practices.
